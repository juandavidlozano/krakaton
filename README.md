# 🚀 Real-Time Query Processing Architecture: Why Each Component Matters

## **1️⃣ Overview**
This document outlines the **key technologies** used in the **real-time analytics architecture**, explaining **why each component was chosen** over alternatives.

### **🔹 Business Use Case**
- Users interact with a **real-time analytics dashboard**.
- Queries are **triggered via Firebase** and sent to **Ray for processing**.
- **Apache Iceberg tables** store the data, ensuring fast retrieval.
- Results are **returned to the UI in real-time**.

---

## **2️⃣ Pipeline Architecture & Technologies**
The **proposed architecture** consists of **six major components**:

| **Component**       | **Purpose** |
|--------------------|------------|
| **Firebase**       | Captures user queries in real-time. |
| **Cloud Functions** | Sends queries from Firebase to Ray. |
| **Ray**           | Distributes query workloads across multiple nodes. |
| **Apache Iceberg** | Provides optimized, columnar storage for fast reads. |
| **Apache Spark**  | Processes complex analytics queries. |
| **Cube.dev**      | Caches & accelerates simple queries for instant responses. |

---

## **3️⃣ Why Firebase? (Not PostgreSQL/MySQL?)**
### **🔥 Role:**
Firebase acts as a **real-time event system**, capturing **user queries from the front-end** and triggering data processing.

### **✅ Why Firebase?**
- **Push-based real-time events** (no polling needed).
- **Auto-scales** for millions of queries.
- **Integrates with Cloud Functions for immediate processing**.

### **🚫 Why Not PostgreSQL/MySQL?**
❌ **Polling databases adds query latency**.  
❌ **Harder to scale for high-frequency events**.  

---

## **4️⃣ Why Cloud Functions? (Not a VM?)**
### **🔥 Role:**
Cloud Functions **act as an event-driven middleware**, forwarding Firebase queries to **Ray**.

### **✅ Why Cloud Functions?**
- **Serverless** (runs only when triggered).
- **Auto-scales with Firebase events**.
- **Integrates with Ray seamlessly**.

### **🚫 Why Not a VM?**
❌ **Always-on cost** for a VM.  
❌ **Manual scaling required**.  

---

## **5️⃣ Why Ray? (Not Just Spark?)**
### **🔥 Role:**
Ray is a **distributed execution framework** that manages **query workloads across multiple nodes**.

### **✅ Why Ray?**
- **Dynamic task scheduling** for distributed execution.
- **Works with multiple compute engines (Spark, Cube, ML models)**.
- **Faster than Spark for lightweight, parallelized queries**.

### **🚫 Why Not Just Spark?**
❌ **Spark does not manage execution across multiple services**.  
❌ **Ray provides finer-grained resource scheduling**.  

---

## **6️⃣ Why Apache Spark? (Not Presto/Trino?)**
### **🔥 Role:**
Apache Spark is a **big data processing engine** used for **complex analytics & transformations**.

### **✅ Why Spark?**
- **Handles complex queries, joins, aggregations, & AI models**.
- **Batch & Streaming support** for large-scale processing.
- **Optimized for Iceberg queries**.

### **🚫 Why Not Presto/Trino?**
❌ **Presto is a query engine but does not support ML or deep transformations**.  

---

## **7️⃣ Why Cube.dev? (Not Just Use Spark?)**
### **🔥 Role:**
Cube.dev is a **caching and pre-aggregation layer** that **speeds up analytics queries**.

### **✅ Why Cube.dev?**
- **Pre-aggregates queries for faster results**.
- **Built-in REST & GraphQL APIs**.
- **Cheaper than running Spark clusters continuously**.

### **🚫 Why Not Just Spark?**
❌ **Spark queries take seconds, but Cube.dev takes milliseconds**.  
❌ **Spark has no built-in API, Cube.dev does**.  

---

## **8️⃣ Why Apache Iceberg? (Not Delta Lake?)**
### **🔥 Role:**
Iceberg is a **high-performance table format** that enables **fast, scalable analytics**.

### **✅ Why Iceberg?**
- **Faster query performance with metadata pruning**.
- **Schema evolution without rewriting data**.
- **ACID transactions & time-travel queries**.

### **🚫 Why Not Delta Lake?**
❌ **Delta Lake is more tied to Databricks**, while Iceberg is **open & widely supported**.

## **9️⃣ Final Summary: Why This Stack?**
| **Component** | **Why It’s Used?** | **Alternative Considered?** | **Why Not?** |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Firebase** | Real-time event trigger | PostgreSQL / MySQL | Polling adds latency |
| **Cloud Functions** | Serverless query routing | Dedicated VM | Always-on cost |
| **Ray** | Distributed execution | Spark-only cluster | Less flexible for multi-engine use |
| **Apache Spark** | Advanced query & ML processing | Presto/Trino | No ML/ETL support |
| **Cube.dev** | Fast query caching & API | Spark SQL | Slower for real-time analytics |
| **Apache Iceberg** | Fast, scalable storage | Hive / Delta Lake | Slower, less flexible |
